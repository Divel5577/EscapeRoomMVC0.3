Escape Room MVC Game
Welcome to the Escape Room MVC Game, a text-based adventure game where you solve puzzles, interact with objects, and try to escape a mysterious room! This project demonstrates the use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to create a modular and extendable console application.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
.NET 6 or later
A compatible text editor or IDE, such as Visual Studio.
Running the Game
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
cd EscapeRoomMVC
Build and run the project:
dotnet build
dotnet run
Saving and Loading
Saved games are stored as JSON files in the application directory.
Ensure that the application has write permissions for the directory.
Adding New Items
To extend the game with new items:

Create a new class inheriting from Item.
Implement specific interactions in the OnInteract method.
Add the new item to the room in the RoomInitializer class.
Example:
public class Lamp : Item
{
    public Lamp(int positionX, int positionY)
        : base("Lamp", "A small desk lamp. It doesn't seem to work.", false, positionX, positionY)
    {
        AddInteraction("Inspect");
    }

    public override void OnInteract(string interaction, Inventory inventory)
    {
        if (interaction == "Inspect")
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The lamp is dusty but has no bulb.");
        }
    }
}
Known Issues
Some interactions may not correctly refresh the map.
Ensure JSON save files are not manually edited to avoid deserialization errors.
